        Our goal is to predict the meaningful data points where seismic events occur. 
        To do this effectively, we decided to use deep learning.

        When we looked at the Lunar data, we only had 77 samples available, which was not enough to predict event points using deep learning. 
        Even after adding additional data provided by NASA, we only managed to collect around 200 samples.
